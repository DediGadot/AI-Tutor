# Hebrew AI Tutor - Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Hebrew AI Tutor system, designed to ensure bulletproof reliability for 5th-grade Hebrew-speaking students learning to code.

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach follows these core principles:

1. **Child Safety First**: Every test ensures the system is safe for children
2. **Hebrew Language Support**: All tests validate proper Hebrew text rendering and RTL layout
3. **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.2 AA standards for inclusive education
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Tests respect Hebrew language and Israeli cultural context
5. **Educational Effectiveness**: Tests ensure the AI tutor provides age-appropriate guidance

## Test Architecture

## Custom Test Matchers

We've extended Jest with Hebrew-specific matchers:

```typescript
expect(text).toContainHebrew();
expect(element).toHaveRTLDirection();
expect(button).toMeetTargetSize();
expect(component).toBeAccessible();
```

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data Factories
- **Student Profiles**: Age-appropriate Hebrew nicknames, realistic progress data
- **Lesson Content**: Theme-specific Hebrew lessons with proper difficulty progression
- **Test Results**: Realistic test outcomes with Hebrew feedback
- **Error Scenarios**: Common coding errors with child-friendly Hebrew explanations

### Fixtures
